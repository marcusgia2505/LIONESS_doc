====================
LIONESS experiment
====================

A standard LIONESS experiment can be created in LIONESS Lab and brings along a set of standard features to enable online interactive experiments. The build-in features are described here. They can be configured when developing an experiment. 

The following figure shows the standard flow of an online experiment and describes all the mechanisms along this flow. Participants log in via a link from an external website (e.g. Amazon MTurk). Then they go through the experiment and at the end they return to the external site to get their payoff.
